# Artifacts-Analyzer

The artifacts analyzer is a Python script for finding correlations among features of archaeological artifacts, for data sets containing Boolean and categorical variables. The program takes a CSV file as input, and outputs text describing meaningful correlations between the variables. It also allows users to contrast two sets of artifacts based on a specific feature (for example, artifacts from two different regions). A Windows executable version of the Artifacts Analyzer (beta version) can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ePPUOuLFRZHPZKGk_ZjKDvHkapPWLmPH/view?usp=sharing): save the zip file to any location on your computer, uncompress it, and lauch the "main.exe" file.
